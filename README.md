### What I learned

This was a really challenging CSS and JavaScript challenge for me 



proud of this :
```js
if (priceBar.value > pricePoints[i-1] &&
        priceBar.value < pricePoints[i]) {
          priceBar.value = pricePoints[i]
          setValue(i)
          
        
      }

 this.style.background = `linear-gradient(to right, var(--Bar-Progress) 0%, var(--Bar-Progress) ${tempValue}%, var(--Empty-Slider-Bar) ${tempValue}%, var(--Empty-Slider-Bar) 100%)`

```
